- Today we just lied down a foundation to work on. Connor experimented with
branching and Nathan just transferred what we had in our UML diagram to code.

-Nathan experimented with the format of the board. Looked at the setup from the
WordSearch lab and used that to print out the board. Nathan then found a way to
label the squares using two axes.

- Went over our UML diagram and started questioning its efficiency.  We
had a very long discussion over Messenger and bounced ideas off of each other.
It was a very productive conversation because neither of us were left offended,
instead, we were able to develop a deeper understanding about out project.

Nathan tried to visualize what we had discussed about having each piece as a
subclass of a class named Piece. We developed questions to ask Mr. K: "Should we
have an array of pieces or an array of Strings?" and "How do we edit/save files"
