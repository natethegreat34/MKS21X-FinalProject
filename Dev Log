Dev Log

January 3, 2018
- Today we just lied down a foundation to work on. Connor experimented with
branching and Nathan just transferred what we had in our UML diagram to code.

-Nathan experimented with the format of the board. Looked at the setup from the
WordSearch lab and used that to print out the board. Nathan then found a way to
label the squares using two axes.

January 5, 2018
- Went over our UML diagram and started questioning its efficiency.  We
had a very long discussion over Messenger and bounced ideas off of each other.
It was a very productive conversation because neither of us were left offended,
instead, we were able to develop a deeper understanding about out project.

Nathan tried to visualize what we had discussed about having each piece as a
subclass of a class named Piece. We developed questions to ask Mr. K: "Should we
have an array of pieces or an array of Strings?" and "How do we edit/save files"

Connor:
Worked on began to code the Chessboard class with the UML diagram as a template

Nathan:
Worked on and finished the Square class as seen in the UML diagram

Both:
We went to the CSDojo to get more face to face planning and we came up with how
the pieces will make their possible move lists and decided that it will generate
its own 2D array of Strings that will hold the places where the piece can curre-
ntly move. It will then send it to the chessboard class and the chessboard will
look at the actual chessboard and give the actual possible moves. The making of
the 2d array strings will be done by for loops that will loop based on the dire-
ction the pieces can move. We also decided that the save file will just save a
chessboard in it with the pieces in it.

Connor:
Designing chessboard methods and how the chess board will work with Lanturna.
Also fixed class pieces.

Nathan:
Continued making the possible moves list for all of the pieces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
January 10, 2018

Both:
We worked through our code together in class.  Got the 2d array of possible
moves to print out correctly and fixed bugs with the possible moves list.  We
went to CS Dojo to study ad also to ask how we will make the pieces move or
insert a text box in order for the player to insert their move.  We texted
Timothy So and we discussed that we will use Screen in order to display our game
so it update once we move and not every second like terminal.
